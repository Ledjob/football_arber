put keys to env
add each result from each league to the corresponding json (good league)
also I would need to find similarities between names and append that to the bookmakers list

maybe : extract a league (for i.e : ligue1) -> create new dict with :  {
        "key": name_of_bookmaker,
        "title": name_of_bookmaker,
        "last_update": date.date.now(),
        "markets": [
          {
            "key": "h2h",
            "last_update": date.date.now(),
            "outcomes": [
              {
                "name": "AC Ajaccio",
                "price": 2.82
              },
              {
                "name": "Rodez AF",
                "price": 2.1
              },
              {
                "name": "Draw",
                "price": 3.13
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }


add an if statement and for each league : (for each competition if competition == league1)
send this to good key (bookmakers.append()) and chose corrrect home and away team with similarities.. (if home_team and away_team is similar to team1 and team2 then add to this bookmakers key)
